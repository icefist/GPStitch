"""Runtime patches for gopro_overlay library.

This module provides runtime patches to extend gopro_overlay functionality
without modifying the original library. Changes include:
- Timecode extraction for Final Cut Pro compatibility
- Enhanced FFmpeg options (audio copy, metadata preservation)
- DJI camera metrics support (metric_accessor patch, always applied)
- DJI SRT→GPX load bypass (gpx_patches, applied conditionally via wrapper
  when --ts-srt-source is present — preserves camera metrics in video render)
- Place name overlay widget (`create_place` component, always applied)
